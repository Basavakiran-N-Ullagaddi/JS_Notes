## What is  Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) ?

* The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior in JavaScript that applies to variables declared with let and const. 
* It refers to the period between entering a scope (like a block or function) and the actual declaration of the variable. 
* During this time, the variable exists but is uninitialized, and any attempt to access it will throw a ReferenceError.

## Purpose:

* Prevents accidental use of variables before they are properly initialized.
* Encourages cleaner, more predictable code. 

Example
1) 
{
  // TDZ starts here
  console.log(myVar); // ReferenceError
  let myVar = 10;     // TDZ ends here
  console.log(myVar); // 10
}

2) 
function demoTDZ() {
  // TDZ starts here for 'x'
  if (true) {
    console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
    let x = 5;      // TDZ ends here
    console.log(x); // 5
  }
}

demoTDZ();
