## Difference between Var, Let and Const ?

* The variables declared with var are function scoped(Available throughout the function where it is declared) or globle scope(if defined outside the function), 
  As it can be reassigned and also fully hoisted with initialized.
* Variables declared with the let and const are blocked scope, her let can be reassigned but const can't. Both of them gets hoisted to top of scope but won't get
  Assigned with any value.(causes Temporal Dead Zone)

// var example
var x = 10;
var x = 20; // re-declaration allowed
x = 30;     // reassignment allowed
console.log(x); // 30

// let example
let y = 10;
// let y = 20; // ❌ Error: cannot re-declare in same block
y = 25; // reassignment allowed
console.log(y); // 25

// const example
const z = 10;
// z = 20; // ❌ Error: cannot reassign
console.log(z); // 10
